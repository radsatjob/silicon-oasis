These are some of the questions that I was asked in interviews in recent times.

import MuiAccordion from '@site/src/components/MuiAccordion';

<MuiAccordion
  items={[
    {
      title: "What are the most frustrating  moments in your career. Take any instance?",
      content: "Not getting developer's bandwidth at RZP, and not getting budget sanctioned for buying tools required for video creation in NF."
    },
    {
      title: "What is the hardest feedback that you ever got?",
      content: "Working with a peer during DITA review sessions, formatting of JSON working with a develo[er, issue with exposing the API keys in a note book and exposing to internet.]."
    }
  ]}
/>

<div style={{
  position: 'relative',
  width: '100%',

</div>
